A way to make budgeting easy. A basic idea for the community, made even better by the community.

We’re in the process of porting the app over to Windows 10 Desktop and Mobile. We’re also working towards a release on Android and iOS via Xamarin.

### Tools
We use Visual Studio 2015. If you use resharper please ensure to use the settings in the repository for this project.

If you don't have a Xamarin Subscription, you may apply for an open source license directly at Xamarin. [Application Formula](https://resources.xamarin.com/open-source-contributor.html)

NOTE: I assume they will only offer this to contributors of an open source project.
