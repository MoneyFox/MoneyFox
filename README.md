A way to make budgeting easy. A basic idea for the community, made even better by the community.

### Try it
There are two versions in the Windows Marketplace available for all devices with Windows 10:

First there is a stable version who get regular udpates as soon as they are fully tested:

Windows (Mobile / Desktop)

[Stable Version](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh6ck9d)

Second there is a beta for all these guys who want get their hands on all the new features who are currently in development. We try to keep this as stable as possible. But nonethless expect some bugs (please report! =) ):

Windows (Mobile / Desktop)

[Beta Version](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh68h8m)

If you wanna have a look how the current development of our Android App is going, you can have a look at our Alpha. Be aware that this isn't nearly stable or feature complete.
