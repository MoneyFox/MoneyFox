## Translation

## Code
You want to contribute code? Great! Look for issues with the following labels, depending on what you are looking for:

- first-timer-only: 

To quote [firsttimersonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/): "I'm willing to hold your hand so you can make your first PR. This issue is rather a bit easier than normal. And anyone who's already contributed to open source isn't allowed to touch this one!"

- up-for-grabs:

This issues should be easy to solve and are great to start if you already have contributed to OSS before and are new here.

- mentor:

This means that I can provide you additional information to help getting started and a basic idea how to solve this.

For any issue regardless of the label I want to encourage you to ask if there are any questions. I'm happy to help.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change something on the Money Fox. There is a [detailed documentation ](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on using pull requests by GitHub itself.

Please make pull requests against the `master` branch.

Also, please ensure you have unit tests written for your changes where possible and that all existing tests are still running.
